We had two major activities planned today, tandem parasailing and snorkeling. It’s time to get wet and wild.

After breakfast, we decided to try taking public transportation to the harbour where the parasailing would depart from. We had previously read reviews that the island’s bus system was quite lackluster, and their <a href="http://www.thebus.org/" target="blank">website</a> certainly indicated as such, so we didn’t have much expectations. It turned out alright, though; the bus was on time and went where we wanted to go in the expected amount of time. The bus driver was nice and helpful too. It was funny seeing them use the same kind of paper transfers that Vancouver used in the ’90s, but they do have the same kind of digital voice and display system that tells riders which stops are coming up and whether a stop has been requested, so it’s not a totally outdated system.

And so we got to the parasailing kiosk, went out on a speed boat, and parasailed. It was fun and surprisingly calming. You basically feel like you’re sitting and floating up in the air, which I suppose is exactly what parasailing is. I was expecting it to be at least a little bit scary, but it wasn’t, probably because the entire ride up and down was very smooth (I cannot say the same for the speed boat ride). V and I went on the Revelation at Playland once and that was much more of a heart dropper.

We bought a $69 for $138 Groupon for this activity. I’d say this was worth the Groupon value, but not the original price. They also got us to buy some blurry pictures from them for $30.

After parasailing we had a couple hours to spare before snorkeling. V had searched online that morning and found a Lebanese place called the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/its-good-and-healthy-caf%C3%A9-honolulu-2" target="blank">Good and Healthy Café</a> (not sure why there's an extra "It's" in Yelp) who supposedly served food that was better than its name, so we started walking toward it. We eventually walked into downtown Honolulu.

I have always known “downtown” of a city to be the busiest part of a city, because it’s true for the two cities I’ve lived in. This is not the case for Honolulu. The busiest part of town is probably Waikiki. It was Saturday, which means nobody was working downtown that day, which means the entire area was completely dead. Which also means that the Good and Healthy Café was closed.

I think it was because this was the second time we’ve been hungry and tired looking for food in Hawaii, but for some reason V did not want to give up. The café was in a business building with multiple doors, so we kept pulling on all the doors we could find. And because that’s not enough to prove it’s closed, V suggested we ask someone. Just then a large man walked to one of the doors from inside the building, all the while looking at us (probably because we looked like two crazies trying to break in), so I pointed him out to V. V met him at the door, and long story short, the man turned out to be the owner of the Good and Healthy Café, and even though he and his wife and son were just setting up for the coming week and not actually opened, he invited us in to have some food. They were all very nice and the pitas were delicious. Mmm.

We walked back to the docks after lunch, and met up with the snorkeling crew. This was a “guided snorkeling tour for two” valued at $140, but booked with a $59 Groupon. Overall it was a good time and worth the 60 bucks because I had never snorkeled before, and more importantly, there were sea turtles swimming below us which was super mega cool. After I was done thrashing and finally got comfortable with the snorkel, I just started following the turtles around. It definitely would not have been worth $140 though. There were three people taking us out: a boat driver, the owner, and our “guide”. The guide basically gave us our gear, answered whatever questions we had, jumped in the water with us, and alerted us whenever she saw sea turtles. On our way back to shore I overheard the owner ask the tour guide to come to a staff meeting. I hope he was going to advise her to do more guiding and touring.

After snorkeling we took a $2 trolley back to our hotel.

For dinner, we went to a Japanese restaurant called the Corner Kitchen. The food was good but pricey, and the service was sub-par. Good thing it was also half paid for with a Groupon.
