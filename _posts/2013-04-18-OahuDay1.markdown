It was never a problem to get the day started in Hawaii. Seeing this view in the morning helped.

Our first full day at Oahu was to be a “walking-around-getting-to-know-the-town” day, which is one of my favourite kind of days. The entire day was spent in Honolulu.

Thanks to V’s research, we found breakfast at Wailana Coffee House, which had a great deal on eggs, bacon, and all-you-can-eat pancakes for $6.95. We ended up not having lunch that day.

The rest of the day was mostly a shopping day.  We didn’t buy much and did a lot of walking, so overall it was a pretty successful shopping day. There is a long strip of big brand name shops all along Kalakaua Avenue (which is parallel to Waikiki Beach) and walking on it always gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling, especially at night. I almost never went in though; being close to expensive merchandise and salespeople who are dressed better than me makes me nervous.

There is also the International Marketplace on Kalakaua Avenue, which is similar to the night markets in Vancouver. Most of the merchandise are small, cheap trinkets that are either made locally or imported from China.  We tried to look for some garb with a local flair (i.e., Hawaiian shirts, sundresses), but we didn’t fall in love with anything with a reasonable price. V was interested in a shirt that was worn by Magnum P.I. The saleslady got confused when he asked to try on the “Burt Reynolds shirt”.

One of the particularities with Honolulu is that there are many, many ABC Stores. ABC Stores is a chain of convenience stores, and there is at least one ABC Store on each block, if not two or three. They’ve really embodied the true meaning of “convenience” in convenience store.

We decided to buy some milk and cereal for rest of the days to save on breakfast. All food was expensive in Hawaii, except for pineapple and papaya, so we bought some of those. Apparently $1.09 for a pound of bananas is cheap for Hawaii (we’re used to $0.29-0.69 in Vancouver). And of course we got some beers for the small fridge in our room.

Near the end of the day we decided on relax on the beach. It was too late to go anywhere besides Waikiki, so we walked to the far end of the beach where there was the least number of people. It was mostly single blokes hanging out there. One guy was snorkeling quite intently, wearing headphones and a bucket at his waist. There must be treasures to be found there.

After we enjoyed a couple beers and the sunset on our balcony, we got chalupas at Taco Bell. V was a happy man that night.
