I just spent six days in Oahu, Hawaii, and I think it was the best vacation I’ve ever had. Granted, I haven’t been on that many vacations overall (especially in recent years), but this island is pretty spectacular.

The worst part of any vacation is always the planning beforehand. We spent a couple days trying to draw out an itinerary, but we only managed to do it for about half of the trip.

I always love the plane ride to the destination, because of all the anticipation and excitement. The take off is always a thrill, especially when you’re leaving a grey, rainy city for a tropical island.

We also went with WestJet for our last vacation (to Coachella), and we were quite pleased with them considering how they bailed us out when we missed our flight by putting us on the very next flight to a city (i.e., Palm Springs) that was even closer to our ultimate destination. This time, however, we realized WestJet is no different from all other North American airlines. Besides two rounds of complimentary beverages and snacks, nothing was provided unless you ponied up. Apparently this was common knowledge. V and I did not know this, and kept expecting food throughout the six hours of the flight. At the end of the flight we were miffed, and starving. I find it amusing that WestJet felt obligated to send us an email telling us there’d be no entertainment on the flight, but did not feel the need to say there would be no meal provided. It ended up feeling like quite the long flight.

When we exited the airport, we were greeted by the sweet, warm air of Hawaii. It was humid and I loved it. It reminded me of Hong Kong. This affinity for the heat did not last, of course.

We took a $12 shuttle from the airport to the hotel. It was worth it to get our tired, famished bodies straight there, hassle-free. In the shuttle was a sign that said “Gratuity is appreciated”, which I mulled over. I would continue to mull over the same issue throughout the entire trip. I’m against the culture of tipping but am always wracked with guilt for not meeting societal expectations. As I continued to mull, we reached our hotel and the driver helped us out. I did not end up tipping the man. (My guilt does not tend to retroactively influence my behaviour.)

When we got to our hotel (Pacific Beach Hotel), the first thing we noticed was a strong stench. I couldn’t quite place it, but it was a smell that again, reminded me of certain places in Hong Kong. V was not a fan of it (not that I was, but it reminded me of my childhood). The smell probably comes from the hotel restaurant, which serves seafood buffet nightly and has a giant aquarium in it that holds “mermaid” shows. Mermaids are pretty and all, but they’re still part fish and are not naturally fragrant.

We got keys and went up to our room. V was in charge of deciding on a hotel and room type and he said he’d gone for the more expensive Ocean-View Room in a four-star hotel, so I was expecting a beaut. I was pretty much speechless when I went into the room and turned on the lights, because it was hella ugly. There was certainly a view of the ocean, if you stuck your neck far out the balcony and looked to the left. I was exhausted though, and just wanted to flop onto the bed, but V managed to convince me to ask for an upgrade. So we did, and the new room was much better. The view was phenomenal, and though the rest of the room was still not the room photographed on the booking site, it was noticeably better.

I still couldn’t flop onto the bed though, because our stomachs were still empty. It was late so the only option was pretty much fast food, and we had to ask around and get lost a couple times before we got to a McDonald’s.

I always like visiting McDonald’s in different countries because they have localised menus, though I wasn’t expecting Hawaii’s to be special in any way because it was part of the States. But how wrong I was. You get a small cup of fresh pineapples with each combo, and they also have a haupia pie, which is basically a coconut pie. It was a delicious meal.

We slept well that night. Next day would be our first full day of adventures on Oahu.
